# Salesforce-Lead-Capture-AI
Automating Hyper-Personalized Follow-Ups with n8n &amp; GPT-4
I have analyzed the "n8n Salesforce Automation Guide" and designed a Single Page Application (SPA) infographic.

### **Plan & Narrative Structure**

1.  **Header & Concept:** "The High-Velocity Sales Loop." Introduces the synergy of CRM, AI, and Instant Communication.
2.  **The Speed Advantage (Bar Chart):** Visualizes the critical difference between Manual vs. Automated response times, highlighting the "1 Minute Polling" feature mentioned in the guide.
3.  **Workflow Architecture (HTML Flow Diagram):** A step-by-step visual breakdown of the 4-stage process (Trigger, AI, Email, SMS) using structured HTML/CSS (No Mermaid/SVG).
4.  **AI Personalization Metrics (Radar Chart):** Compares a Standard Template vs. GPT-4 Generated content across metrics like "Context", "Warmth", and "Relevance" based on the prompt engineering steps.
5.  **Optimization & Filtering (Doughnut Chart):** Visualizes the "Filtering Bad Leads" optimization, showing saved API credits/resources.
6.  **Conversation Impact (Line Chart):** Projected increase in lead engagement over time using this workflow.
